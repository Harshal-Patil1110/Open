    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to organize and structure code around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. OOP allows programmers to create reusable and modular code, improve code organization and maintainability, and create more complex and flexible software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, OOP is implemented using classes, which define the attributes and methods that objects of that class can have. Attributes are the data associated with an object, while methods are the functions that can be performed on that data. By using OOP principles, programmers can create objects with unique properties and behaviors that can interact with each other and with the larger program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key benefits of using OOP in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: OOP allows developers to encapsulate data and behavior within objects, which helps to reduce the complexity of the code and make it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: OOP also supports inheritance, which allows developers to create new classes that inherit the attributes and methods of existing classes, thus enabling code reuse and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: OOP also supports polymorphism, which allows developers to write code that can work with objects of different types and classes, thus making the code more flexible and adaptable."

If the attribute is not found in the instance, Python then searches for the attribute in the class of the instance, and then in the superclasses of that class, according to the MRO."
